# Minesweeper

My first project with a graphical interface using the **MVC** pattern in **100% Java**.  

## Author  
**wGamba**  

## Requirements  
- **JDK 23**  
- **JavaFX** (necessary libraries for the graphical interface)  

## Setup  

To run the game, you need to configure the **JavaFX** module.  
If you encounter issues running the program, make sure to add the following argument in the run configuration:

"vmArgs": "--module-path "PATH_TO_YOUR_JAVAFX\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"

## Note  
I was unable to export the game as an executable file due to **JavaFX** dependencies, so it must be run from a properly configured development environment.
